Create a new tag, and wait 2 minutes.

## DEPRECATED

Probably the most complex part of this project is the deployment (and it's super simple!)

There are a few steps:

1. Obtain access keys
2. Create a `.env` file.
3. Change `serverless.yml` to match your current deployment environment.
4. Deploy!
